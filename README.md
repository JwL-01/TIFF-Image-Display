**Introduction**
---
TIFF Image Viewer, is a Java application created using Java and libraries such as JavaFx, JavaSwing and JavaAWT. This application is designed to read uncompressed TIFF images and display them on the screen using rendering techiniques.

**Project Goals & Objectives**
---
The goal of this project was to learn how to create an application using Java, to be able to read bits and to understand RGB values. In the application, there are three colour modifying options that are availiable for the image. You are able to grey scale, half the brightness, dither and auto level the image by pressing the next button.
- Understand Java Programming:
  - This project serves as a hands-on tutorial for mastering Java. I gained insights into Java's object-orientated principles, and graphical user interface development.
- Bit Manipulation and Image Reading:
  - I learned how to interpret binary data, image structures and how to retrieve pixel information.
- RGB & YUV Values:
  - I learned to manipulate and understand RGB and YUV values of pixels. In order to implement the grey scale, half brightness, dithering, auto level adjustments, I needed to apply the formula for luminance.
